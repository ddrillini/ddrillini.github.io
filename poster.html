	<h1>Stepchart Reference</h1>
	 <p>The pattern reference poster started as an illustration on a whiteboard in the Illini Union Rec Room in 2015. It was made by Tana, a senior member of DDRIllini, probably for the purpose of explaining 4-panel patterning to freshmen in the club.</p>

	 <p>Several years later, we saw it circulating around Russian dance game Twitter, and <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2016/proceedings.pdf">cited in an academic paper</a> (ctrl f "honk honk"). Some of the Russians in the Twitter thread ended up traveling to RIP11 (2019), so Tana decided to make a poster verion of the whiteboard.</p>

	 <p>We got lots of requests, so we made the poster available in a digital format so you can print your own. You can <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/ddrillini">get it at Gumroad</a>.</p>
